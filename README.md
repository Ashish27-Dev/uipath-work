KLM Lost and Found Alerts

This project aims to automate the Lost and Found process by processing the inventory file and integrating it with the KLM flight Status webpage. It sends email notifications for the passengers who left items behind during their journey with KLM flights. The system will also track the number of emails sent, enhancing efficiency and accuracy for our 'Lost & Found' team.
